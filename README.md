## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-tinacms-blog-kit
```

Rename your project and jump into the folder.

### Install Node dependencies
Install the Node dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Initialize Tina CMS

Initialize [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) with the following command:

```
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

When Tina prompts to override your App component, reject by typing "n" (it's already set up):
```
✔ do you want us to override your _app.tsx? … no
```

This command will generate some redundant files; feel free to remove them.

Decorate the following commands with `--experimentalData` to enable querying and filtering your graphql content with Tina:

```
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development tinacms server:start -c \"next dev\" --experimentalData",
"build": "tinacms server:start -c \"next build\" --experimentalData",
"start": "tinacms server:start -c \"next start\" --experimentalData",
```

NB: do not forget to prefix the `dev` command with `NODE_ENV=development`.

#### Setting up the Tina CMS schema

Copy the contents of the file `schema.template` and override the content of `schema.ts`. Tina CMS will initialize the correct GraphQL schema based on the schema we provided.

### Run the application

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your blog
2. Visit [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to access the Tina CMS admin
3. Visit [http://localhost:4001/altair](http://localhost:4001/altair) to access the GraphqQL playground

Remove `.tina` from the `.gitignore` file, and remember to check it in, so that your builds will be able to use the folder.

#### Inline Tina Editor

Because Tina lazy-loads the inline editor in production mode, **but does not disable it**, I thought the best compromise was to dynamicaly add the editor based on a variable.

By default, the editor is loaded only if the URL contains a query parameter named `tina`. You can change this logic as you prefer in `_app.tsx`.

#### Using Tina Cloud? 

If you're also using Tina Cloud, remember to add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` environment variable, either from a `.env` file or from your Vercel console (or other provider).

You will find the Client ID environment variable in the [Tina CMS Dashboard](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/dashboard/).

### Setting the upstream folder

If you want, reinitialize the git repository and set this repository as your upstream, so you can continue getting updates:

```
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add upstream https://github.com/makerkit/next-tinacms-blog-kit
```

To keep your repository up-to-date with this, use `git pull`:

```
git pull upstream main 
```

Solve the eventual conflicts and merge 😃

### Configuration

Open the configuration file at `./configuration.ts`. It will have the following content:

```tsx
const configuration = {
  site: {
    name: '',
    description: '',
    themeColor: '',
    siteUrl: '',
    siteName: '',
    twitterHandle: '',
    githubHandle: '',
    language: 'en',
  },
  blog: {
    maxReadMorePosts: 6,
  },
  production: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
};
```

Update it with your own data, or leave as is to begin with.

### Enter the Tina CMS Admin

After starting the development server, access the following URL: https://localhost:3000/admin.

Time to get writing!

### Add Articles, Categories and Authors manually

Before creating a blog post, we define which collection it belongs to and the author of the post.

To define a category, create a JSON file at `content/categories`:

```json
{
  "name": "Tutorials",
  "emoji": "🖥️"
}
```

Alternatively, you can choose to assign a picture to each collection (or neither):

```json
{
  "name": "Tutorials",
  "picture": "/assets/images/tutorials.png"
}
```

Next, we need to add the author of the article. Add a JSON file at `_authors`:

```json
{
  "name": "MakerKit",
  "picture": "/assets/images/makerkit.png",
  "url": "https://twitter.com/makerkit_dev"
}
```

We can now create a blog post. Add an MDX file at `_posts`:

```yaml
---
title: 'Dextera Sibi Orbes'
category: 'content/categories/lorem-ipsum.json'
author: 'content/authors/makerkit.json'
date: 2022-03-30
live: true
image: ''
description: "Lorem markdownum ictu; leti quae, paenituisse venere. Liquet praemia omne di
amarunt dicta."
---
```

As you can see, the properties `category` and `author` are references to the path of each.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
